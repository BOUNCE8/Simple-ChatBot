# Codeworks Pre Course Curriculum

This pre course is important, because it allows all students to have a solid common ground when the main course starts.

Keep in mind we’re providing two check-ins and support sessions with instructors along the way, to test your progress, help you clarify any doubts, and be sure you’re on track for success.

## Course structure

The pre course material is divided in two main parts: theory and exercises (as respectively described in the `theory.md`, and `exercises.md` files). We suggest you to start with theory sections from 1 to 6, and then do the exercises while you complete theory sections 7 and 8 on the side.

## Study tips

If a concept is not clear, look for extra information online (videos, tutorials, blogs, forums, etc). Also, consider sleeping over it and tackle it again the next day: you’ll notice that in the meantime your brain keeps elaborating information in the background.

Another important resource is the “Intro to programming” [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/269692903396564/): use it to interact with other students and get unstuck. Instructors loosely follow the conversation, and will help when needed.

After having taken the above steps, make sure you keep a written list of anything that you still want to clarify, so you can discuss it with instructors during the support sessions. Our advice is to distribute the two sessions evenly as you progress through the pre course material. To book a session with instructors simply use any of the contact methods provided on [our website](https://codeworks.me/contacts).

Finally, in case you find any bugs, broken links, typos, outdated info, or have feedback on how to improve this curriculum please send an email to “instructors@codeworks.me”, so we can keep making it better.

### Extra credits

After you have completed all theory and exercises, if you have time left to study before joining the main course, feel free to challenge yourself with the “extra credits” sections.

These sections are not mandatory, and can take a long time to complete, but offer a sneak peek into some topics that will be covered during the main course.

## Ready, set, go!

Ok, now you should be ready to start digging into `theory.md`!
